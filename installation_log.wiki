* ifconfig -a

==== Partitioning ====
- if you have a laptop and going to be using hibernation,
  then swap = RAM or  swap = RAM * 2, else 2-4GB should suffice, I'll go with 4, because
  i'm going be using "suspend to RAM".

* fdisk /dev/sda (if you have SATA and /nvme0.. if you have NMVe)
* g, n, Enter, Enter, +1G (256MiB would be enough, but i'm gonna be having 2 kernels)
* t, 1 for EFI System; n, Enter, +4GB (for a swap), t, 19; n, Enter, Enter, Enter;
* reboot just in case
