=== -march=native and -mtune=native ===
Both are flags for cpp, c and fortran compilers, which specify target architecture, *native* selects current
system's target architecture. Using both flags are fine, but *-march=native* can basically do the work of both.
So i'll use just this one.
* *COMMON_FLAGS="-march=native -O2 -pipe"*
- it's a variable that used for CFLAGS, CXXFLAGS, FCFLAGS and FFLAGS.
